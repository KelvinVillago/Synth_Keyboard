# Synth_Keyboard
Final Project for EE 329 class at Cal Poly SLO
The objective is to create a synthetic keyboard. The NUCLEO board is used as the controller and connects to an LCD display, the keys, and an amplifier. The amplifier is of the push-pull type and is used to provide increased current to the speakers as the NUCLEO cannot support the power necessary to drive the speakers.
